# Heart-disease-predictor-model
 Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of input features.
The model is trained on a dataset of patient characteristics and medical history, and can be used to identify individuals at high risk of heart disease.
Dataset

The dataset used to train the model consists of [insert number] samples, each with [insert number] features. The features include:

1.Demographic information (age, sex, etc.)
2.Medical history (hypertension, diabetes, etc.)
3.Lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise, etc.)
4.Laboratory test results (blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.)

Model Architecture

The model is a [insert type of model, e.g. random forest, neural network, etc.] that takes in the input features and outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood of heart disease. 
The model is trained using [insert training algorithm, e.g. gradient descent, etc.] and evaluated using [insert evaluation metrics, e.g. accuracy, precision, recall, etc.].

Features

Predictive Modeling: The model can predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a set of input features.
Interpretability: The model provides feature importance scores, allowing clinicians to understand which factors contribute most to the prediction.
Scalability: The model can be easily deployed on large datasets and can handle high-dimensional data.
